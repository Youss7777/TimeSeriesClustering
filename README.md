# Time series clustering and validation

## About

This project provides a comprehensive framework for clustering time series data using different algorithms such as TimeSeriesKMeans and KShape from the tslearn package, with validation based on a range of indices. It includes support for validating clustering quality using silhouette index, Dunn index, Davies-Bouldin index, and more. Although the project is initially designed to analyze the time series collected from a psychological experiment on the phenomenon of Insight, it can be customized to fit various time series datasets and provides modular configuration for different clustering settings.
