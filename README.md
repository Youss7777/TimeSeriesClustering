# Time series clustering and validation

## About

This project provides a comprehensive framework for clustering time series data using K-means and K-Shape as algorithms (from the tslearn package), and 3 different metrics as similarity measures: Euclidean distance, Dynamic Time Warping and Cross-correlation. Additionally, the validation of clustering quality is based on a variety of indices, including the silhouette index, Dunn index, Davies-Bouldin index, and more.

Originally designed to analyze time series data collected from a psychological experiment on the phenomenon of Insight, the framework is customizable and can be adapted to various time series datasets and clustering configurations.
