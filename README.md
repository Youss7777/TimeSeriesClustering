# Time series clustering and validation

## About

This project provides a comprehensive framework for clustering time series data using algorithms such as TimeSeriesKMeans and KShape from the tslearn package. It supports the validation of clustering quality based on a variety of indices, including the silhouette index, Dunn index, Davies-Bouldin index, and more.

Originally designed to analyze time series data collected from a psychological experiment on the phenomenon of Insight, the framework is highly customizable and can be adapted to various time series datasets.
